      <button class="accordion">Assessment</button>
<div class="panel">

  <h1>Assessment</h1>
  <p>Assessments theoretically serve a purpose of measuring how much
     you have learned (i.e. how much you have achieved of the course goals).
     I would recommend you to first focus on your learning, then grades will
      follow. I hope you can focus on your own learning.
      It is my intent to design assessments that are a source of
      intellectual curiosity, joy, and learning rather than a source
      of stress. The timezone of this course is PDT.<br /><br /></p>

  <h2>Attendance and Participation</h2>

  This course is taught asynchronously and synchronously which means that you will learn the content of the course
  by watching videos at a time that is convenient for you and attend zoom session at the scheduled times.
	For the zoom session my expectation is that not only you attend but also participate actively in discussions by asking or answering questions.

  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>Problem Sets </h2>
  <p>Problem sets are an opportunity to practice
     the topics learned in the lecture videos. They are graded for completion and effort. 
	 Incorrect solutions are acceptable but incomplete solutions are not. I hold the right to decide if enough effort is put into solving the problem. 
     You can work on problem sets individually or in groups
     but each one of you needs to submit separately.
     Working together means discussing reasoning for questions.
     You need to write your solutions independently from one another. 
     We will use synchronous sessions to get in groups and work together.
     Synchronous sessions are not a good time to start problem sets.
     You should attempt problem sets before coming on zoom.
	The problem sets are assigned at the beginning of the week and are due Wednesday at 09:00 pm.

      <br />
    </p>
  



  <h2>Midterm Exam</h2>
  <p>Midterm exam will be timed.
    The midterm exam is scheduled during the synchronous session on August 16.
</p>
  <h2>Final Exam</h2>
  <p>The final exam will have two parts, written and oral.
   The written exam is scheduled during the synchronous session on September 1.
	  The oral exam will need to be scheduled individually for the week of Aug 30 - September 3. Scheduling instructions will be shared later.

            Grades will <b>not</b> be curved and will <b>not</b> be rounded.

<h5>Late work</h5>

The pace of the summer session is so fast that late work would make you fall behind drastically. The work is expected to be submitted on time. 
	However if there is any acceptable reason (e.g. religious holiday, atheletic competition etc.) please communicate with me in advance regarding accommodations.

<button class="accordion">Academic Honesty</button>
<div class="panel">
  <br>
  <p>You are expected to comply to rules set by the <a href="https://aisc.uci.edu/">Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct</a>
     Each assignment will be clearly labeled with instructions on whether you can work with others or not.
      If there are no instructions you should assume that the work should be completed by you only from start to finish.
      Academic dishonesty includes, for example, cheating on examinations or any assignment, plagiarism of any kind (including improper citation of sources), having someone else take an examination or complete an assignment for you (or doing this for someone else), or any activity in which you represent someone elseâ€™s work as your own.
      Violations of academic integrity will be referred to the Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct.
      You cannot share or distribute solutions online or offline or in any media now or in the future.
      You cannot obtain solutions from others.
      If there is evidence that you have violated academic conduct intentionally or unintentionally YOU WILL FAIL THE CLASS.
      This rule applies even if you violate the policies of this course on a single problem on an assignment, the whole assignment, or multiple assignments.
      No matter what the degree of academic dishonesty is you will fail the class.
     It is your responsibility to protect your answers being copied.
     Make sure not to save work on shared folders.
     It may be difficult to distinguish helping each other learn and studying together with violating academic honesty. If you are unsure of the distinction check with me before hand.</p>
